# What is the ALA?

The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) provides everyone, from researchers to citizen scientists, open access to Australia's bioversity data.  This has been used in everything, from X to Y.

# Why do I want to provide my data to the ALA?

Providing your data to the ALA will put you in good company, as citizen scientists, governments, museums and other collections are among the many entities that share data with the ALA.  This data can then be used by governments, consulting firms, and researchers for decision making and impactvul scientific research.

# How can I share my data with the ALA?

We will get into more detail in today's workshop; however, the easiest way to provide us data is by giving us something called a Darwin Core Archive.  What this is and how to make it will be explained in this workshop.
