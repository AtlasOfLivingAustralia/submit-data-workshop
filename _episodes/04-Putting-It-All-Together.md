# How do I generate a Darwin Core Archive now?

From here, you have your data in the correct format - now, it's time to create an archive.  For this, ensure you have all of your edited files in the same folder.  Right-click on your folder and hit `Compress` on a Mac, `Archive` on Windows, or `something` on Linux.

From there, you can email your Darwin Core Archive to `email here`.
